# jsProjects
Just practicing js with fun projects.

This project is based on one of the projects from freeCodeCamp. 
First part generates random colors from one of these colors:['green', 'red', 'rgba(133,122,200)','#f15025'].
Whereas, second part generates from colors by generating random 6-digit hex value color.
